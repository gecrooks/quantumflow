Qubits
======

States, gates, and various other methods accept a list of qubits labels upon
which the given State or Gate acts. A Qubit label can be any hashable python
object, but typically an integer or string. e.g. `[0, 1, 2]`, or
`['a', 'b', 'c']`. Note that some operations expect the qubits to be sortable,
so don't mix different incomparable data types.
