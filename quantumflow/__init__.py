# Design Notes:
#
# We import the entire public interface to the top level so that users
# don't need to know the internal package layout.
# e.g. `from quantumflow import something`
# or `import quantumflow as qf; qf.something`
#
# We don't include `.utils` since those are internal utility routines.
#
# Submodules for interfacing with external resources (e.g. .xcirq, .xforest, etc.)
# are not imported at top level, since they have external dependencies that
# often break, and need not be installed by default.
#
# We use a star import here (which necessitates suppressing lint messages)
# so that the public API can be specified in the individual submodules.
# Each of these submodules should define __all__.
#
#
# Import hierarchy:
#
#   utils
#   config
#   tensors
#   var
#   qubits
#   states
#   paulialgebra
#   ops
#   gates
#   stdgates
#   channels
#   stdops
#   circuits
#   dagcircuit
#   gatesets
#   decompositions
#   gradients
#   info
#   transform
#   translate
#   visualization
#   deprecated
#   transpile
#   ext
